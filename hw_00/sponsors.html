            <h2>Alfredo Linguini</h2>
            <p>
                He cares greatly for Remy, whom he treats as his equal and best friend, and his girlfriend Colette, with whom he has been in love with since he first saw her and with whom he develops a close romantic relationship with. Overall, Linguini is a kindhearted, yet clutzy person who tries his best to help others and moves people with his kindness and honesty.

            <h2>Auguste Gusteau</h2>
            <p>
                He is a renowned and extremely talented chef who wrote the bestseller Anyone Can Cook and founded the restaurant Gusteau's, which merited five stars. His personal motto is that anyone can cook, and is prone to producing recipes with unusual flairs. He was the youngest chef in history to obtain a 5-star restaurant, and was among the finest chefs worldwide.

            <h2>Anton Ego</h2>
            <p>
                Ego is an imperious and acerbic food critic, whose reviews have been known to ruin restaurants. He strongly objected to Gusteau's belief that anyone can cook, and was a firm critic of the idealist chef. Upon disliking the cooking, Ego gave Gusteau's restaurant a harsh review, causing it to lose one of its five stars. Gusteau died of a broken heart shortly after, which lost the restaurant another star. In his review, he compared Chef Gusteau to the Italian-American chef Chef Boyardee, another well-known and respected chef who became a frozen food mascot after his passing.
